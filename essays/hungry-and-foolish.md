"Stay hungry, stay foolish." That was the message one of my best instructors
left me with at the end of the Spring 2024 semester from [Steve
Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc). That advice has done so much
for me in everything that involves my computer, and I'd like to spend a bit of
time talking about how.

There may be many subtly different interpretations of this advice. My
interpretation mapped well to my life however, and is simply the following:

*Constantly chase for something better with little regard for anything else.*

Now, applying this to absolutely everything in life makes for an excellent means
to have no friends and be constantly unhappy. However, I think there's something
to be said about applying this to one's own performance and workflow.

+ How can I make this more performant?
+ How can I make this faster?
+ Do I need to run Photoshop to process 100 images manually over the course of
hours? Or, can I do that in the terminal and complete the task in a few minutes?
+ This process is tedious. Can I automate it?

These questions and many more are ones that I've asked in the past, and can
explain why I have the propensity to heavily optimize my workflow and move fast
at times. This kind of thinking is the reason why some people stare at my
screen, bewildered by the fact that I appear to just fly around my computer so
fast while making it look so easy. This interpretation of mine has served me
well in my endeavors, as it allowed me to reallocate the time consumed by tedium
to other fun and meaningful tasks.

I don't recommend starting any new "chases" when time doesn't allow it, as any
fix applied is an investment into the future: it wouldn't do to invest during a
bad time. However, I implore you to think about whether there's anything you can
chase after, so that when the time comes, you can go forth and make things
better for yourself in the long run.
