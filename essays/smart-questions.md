"You've tried everything you could, you've asked everyone you could, and you
acknowledge that an answer is a gesture of kindness, not an obligation. Only
then, you may ask your question."

To a certain extent, that statement has been my attitude towards asking my
instructors for help with my homework assignments during university. I felt that
it'd be a tad rude of me to immediately ask for "help" without trying to solve
the problems myself, with friends, or with external tutorials and resources. In
practice, this had a few disadvantages, with a big one being an increased time
requirement for me to complete assignments. On the upside though, I found that
most instructors were very receptive to my questions. I assumed that was because
those instructors were just patient, but I recently realized that my attitude
towards asking questions may have positively affected their receptiveness. And
as it turns out, this experience isn't something that's unique to me.

In 2001, Eric Raymond wrote an article titled "How To Ask Questions The Smart
Way," in which he roughly discusses ways programmers can seek help from other
programmers. That article has gone through several revisions, with the most
recent one being from 2014 that is available for reading
