"You've tried everything you could, you've asked everyone you could, and you
acknowledge that an answer is a gesture of kindness, not an obligation. Only
then, you may ask your question."

To a certain extent, that statement has been my attitude towards asking my
instructors for help with my homework assignments during university. I felt that
it'd be a tad rude of me to immediately ask for "help" without trying to solve
the problems myself, with friends, or with external tutorials and resources. In
practice, this had a few disadvantages, with a big one being an increased time
requirement for me to complete assignments. On the upside though, I found that
most instructors were very receptive to my questions. I assumed that was because
those instructors were just patient, but I recently realized that my attitude
towards asking questions may have positively affected their receptiveness. My
thoughts on that influence from assuming a very "strict" stance on asking
questions is something that I'd like to share briefly.
