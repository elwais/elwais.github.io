I was going through some material from a course I took last semester at the time
of writing. That course was EE-205: Object-Oriented Programming, designed for
computer engineering majors. At the time, I wasn't a computer engineer but still
opted to take it because I wanted to improve my ability to code. (Though, that's
a story for another time.)

I bring this up because of something that I'm *certain* my instructor mentioned,
but I just couldn't find. He was providing a list of things every developer
should aim to do in the future, and these were 2 of the items that I recall
seeing on that list:

---

+ *Join a language/standards committee.*
+ *Leave that committee after a few months.*

## Why Join and Leave?

With no context or explanation, I found those points to be very confusing! After
all, why would one go out of their way to join a committee that can dictate the
fate of something used by many programmers around the world, only to rush out
after a certain time limit had elapsed? My instructor then explained that this
brief stint in the committee had a very specific purpose: to learn about the
decisions behind design choices *without getting too attached*.

I'd like to tease that reasoning apart a bit more, and start why one would even
want to understand design choices in the first place.

### Why Standards Matter

Personally, I think standards matter because of 2 things: uniformity and
quality. The former is something that most of us tend to like without realizing.
Whether it's the lack of inconsistency that makes us feel that we have control
in our lives or the uniformity of what we see (think of a rustic home that is
rustic everywhere, or a high-end restaurant that has nary a speck of dust or
dirt anywhere).
